# Task Routine
**TaskRoutine.py** is the key structure of this Dongle-Handler. The basic routine of the DongleHandler is done with `TaskRoutine.start_routine()`.

Class **TaskRoutine** consists of `device`, `connection_type`, `task_list`, and `iteration`.
 * The `device` is an instance generated from **Device** class. You can find more detail about device in [device.md](https://github.com/hipiphock/Dongle-Handler/docs/device.md).

* `connection_type` determines whether the connection type is BLE format or Zigbee format. If `connection_type == 0`, then it is communicating with ZigBee protocol. If `connection_type == 1`, then it is communicating with BLE protocol.

* `task_list` is a list, with each element being an instance generated by **Task** class.

* The `iteration` is an integer that determines the iteration number of `task_list`.
